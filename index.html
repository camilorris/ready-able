    <p>
      I'm gonna take a stab at this
      <br />
      Sure you will be alright <br />Make a decision with a kiss <br />Maybe I
      have frostbite <br />
      And when I shuffled on back home <br />
      I made sure all of my tracks in the snow <br />Were gone
    </p>
    <p>
      Tissue and bones, it was a tryst <br />This isn't a gunfight
      <br />Checking it off my list <br />Unable to rewrite <br />Five years,
      countless months and a loan <br />Hope I'm ready, able to make my own
      <br />Good home <br />They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did
      <br />They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I did <br />They go,
      we go, I want you to know what I did, I did <br />They go, we go, I want
      you to know what I did, I did <br />They go, we go, I want you to know
      what I did, I did <br />They go, we go, I want you to know what I did, I
      did
